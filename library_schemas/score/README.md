# HED-SCORE

HED-SCORE is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation of Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE)[1,2] for describing events occurring during neuroimaging time series recordings. The HED-SCORE library schema allows neurologists, neurophysiologists, and brain researchers to annotate electrophysiology recordings using terms from an internationally accepted set of defined terms (SCORE) compatible with the HED framework. The resulting annotations are understandable to clinicians and directly usable in computer analysis.

Future extensions may be implemented in the HED-SCORE library schema. For more information see the [**hed-schemas docs**](https://www.hedtags.org/hed-schemas/).

The Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) is a standard terminology for scalp EEG data assessment designed for use in clinical practice that may also be used for research purposes. The SCORE standard defines terms for describing phenomena observed in scalp EEG data. It is also potentially applicable (with some suitable extensions) to EEG recorded in critical care and neonatal settings. The SCORE standard received European consensus and has been endorsed by the European Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission on European Affairs. A second revised and extended version of SCORE achieved international consensus.

## Transition from HED SCORE major version 1 to 2

HED SCORE release 2.0.0 represents a major reorganization of HED SCORE so that it more closely aligns with the nominal SCORE standard as specified in Beniczky et al. 2013, 2017. The artifacts were moved to the HED standard schema and HED hierarchy was reorganized to better reflect the underlying concepts. The formal GitHub release of 2.0.0 includes a spreadsheet explaining how each term in HED SCORE 1.2.0 evolved in HED SCORE 2.0.0.
