
# CHANGELOG for HED lang library schema

## Release 1.1.0 - June 10, 2025

This is a minor release of the HED lang library schema. It includes changes to the schema and tags, as well as updates to the documentation. 
The changes are backward compatible with previous version of the schema.

- The annotations have been moved to a schema attribute to allow programmatic linking to other ontologies.
- The mediawiki and XML formats are now completely equivalent to the tsv version.
- The schema is partnered with HED schema version 8.4.0.

**Tags:**
 - Building-part (Minor): Item Building-part added
 - Door (Minor): Item Door added
 - Window (Minor): Item Window added
 - Attic (Minor): Tag Attic moved in schema from Item/Object/Man-made-object/Building/Attic to Item/Object/Man-made-object/Building-part/Attic

However this has never been widely adopted. In context of HED Language as an Item works.

 - Present-tense (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Language-item-form (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Following https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/ (which is not an ontology for language annotation but an ontology for lexical entries in ontologies) we do not make the form of language inherent to language items but instead attach it separately. The word itself is a concept but it can be expressed in multiple forms. The same is true for a sentence phrase or clause. For some units it is more complicated but there is a spoken form of a letter or grapheme etc. and depending on the writing system there might be a written form of a vowel or consonant. This distinction increases flexibility.
 - Spoken-form (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Canonical-spoken-form (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Should be commonly used (although there is no language without accent) only use regional spoken form when this is relevant in context of the dataset.
 - Mispronounced-spoken-form (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Regional-spoken-form (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Use when relevant in context of dataset.

 - Classifier (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics),rdfs:comment Classifiers are subdivided by GOLD into Nominal Noun and Numeral classifiers. OLIA lists classifier under morphosyntactic category unique (a class for categories with unique or small membership). Classifiers can have different functions across languages. In Chinese count and mass Classifiers are distinguished. Given that these might be language specific and there is no agreement in existing standards we have not added subcategories for now.

 - Particle (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_particle#cite_note-Glossary_Particle-3,rdfs:comment In Olia they use the term Unique and recommends not using particle because of differing definitions. Particle has an older use but the modern definition is well defined and word particle is used in neuroimaging studies (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11347875/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22341872/).

 - Morpheme-property (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Morphemes can be categorized based on position function and type. A morpheme property can be applied to a Morpheme.
 - Morpheme-function (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Inflective-morphological-function (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Conjugate (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Combine with grammatical category what the morpheme adjusted (can be multiple in aggulating languages)
 - Decline (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Combine with grammatical category what the morpheme adjusted (can be multiple in aggulating languages)
 - Word-formation-function (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Compound (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Derivation (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Derivation changes the meaning of a word (for instance reverses the meaning or changes intensity). We do not cover all the semantic types of changes that can be the result of morphological changes but instead give a higher level categorization. Further specification might depend on a more semantic schema.
 - Change-word-class (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Combine with Lexical-role to express what the process has resulted in. Follows Category-changer concept in GOLD but instead of extending further HED can fulfil the same function by tagging it together with a lexical role.
 - Morpheme-type (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Bound-morpheme-type (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Free-morpheme-type (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Morphological-position (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original
 - Affix (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Affix is a categorization of morpheme based on its position. In OLIA this is a subclass of Morpheme. However there are other categorizations of morphemes based on how they change the stem of the word (categorized in OLIA as Morphological processes such as Clitization or reduplication). However since these all say something about how the morpheme is applied to the word we believe these fit better together under the position tag.

 - Orthographic-type (Patch): Attribute annotation modified from None to dc:source Original,rdfs:comment Classification of writing systems is complex and these categories are not universally accepted (mainly because most writing systems have characteristics of multiple of these categories). However most writing systems have an overall tendency towards one of these categories and so the categories can be useful to see how large differences are managed by the individuals who speak them. But it is normal that a writing system does not cleanly fit into any of these categories.
