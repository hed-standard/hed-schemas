# HED LANG Library Schema

 The HED Language library schema (HED LANG Schema) contains vocabulary for annotating language experiments in cognitive science. The schema allows for detailed annotation of neuroimaging experiments that involve language events. It is suitable for experiments using carefully controlled experiment stimuli to address specific questions in the domain of language processing, and for experiments using complex naturalistic paradigms involving written or spoken language.

HED LANG allows for annotation of language stimuli on different levels through the orthogonal definition of Language-items and Language-item-properties. Full sentences can be annotated with sentence-level characteristics, and individual words can be associated with word-level characteristics. Annotation possibilities are extensive and cover characteristics found across languages to allow for comparisons between languages.

The current release of the schema is primarily centered around written language, and morphosyntactic word properties. The schema is open to extension.

## Example annotations

You can find several example annotations of recent work in psycholinguistics in the [HED Lang ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04282-0).

Additionally, we have added annotations to several datasets which are publicly available on OpenNeuro. Their annotated versions (and links to the original) can be found here:

- [ds002155](https://data.anc.plus.ac.at/bids-datasets/openneuro/ds002155)
