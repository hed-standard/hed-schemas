# LISA Library Schema

LISA is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors Library Schema for Linguistic Stimuli Annotation. The schema allows for detailed annotation of neuroimaging experiments that involve language events, from carefully controlled experiments addressing specific questions in the domain of language processing, to more complex naturalistic paradigms involving written or spoken language.

LISA allows for annotation of language stimuli on different levels through the orthogonal definition of Language-items and Language-item-properties. Full sentences can be annotated with sentence-level characteristics, while the individual words in the sentence can be associated with word-level characteristics, and so on. Annotation possibilities are extensive and cover characteristics found across languages to allow for between language comparisons.

The current prerelease of the schema is primarily centered around written language and current development focuses on adding grammatical aspect characteristics and spoken word characteristics into the vocabulary.
