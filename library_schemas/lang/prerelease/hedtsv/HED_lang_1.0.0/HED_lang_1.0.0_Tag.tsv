The word itself is a concept, but it can be expressed in multiple forms. The same is true for a sentence, phrase, clause. For some units it is more complicated, but there is a spoken form of a letter, grapheme, etc. and depending on the writing system there might be a written form of a vowel or consonant. This distinction increases flexibility."
