	LangPrologue		HedPrologue	"The HED Language schema is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors Library Schema Language stimuli and experiments. The schema allows for detailed annotation of neuroimaging experiments that involve language events, from carefully controlled experiments specifically targeting the neuroscience of language processing, to more complex naturalistic paradigms that involve written or spoken language. HED Language schema allows for annotation of language stimuli on different levels through the orthogonal definition of Language-units and Language-unit-properties. Full sentences can be annotated with sentence-level characteristics, while the individual words in the sentence can simultaneously be associated with word-level characteristics, and so on. Annotation possibilities are extensive and cover characteristics of multiple language allowing for comparisons between languages. "
	LangEpilogue		HedEpilogue	The current prerelease of the schema is primarily centered around written language and current development focuses on adding grammatical aspect characteristics and spoken word characteristics into the vocabulary.
