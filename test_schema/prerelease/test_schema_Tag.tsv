Frontalis and temporalis muscles (e.g. clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain. The frequency components are usually beyond 30-50 Hz, and the bursts are arrhythmic.	Biological-artifact

HED_0012499	5	Eye-blink-artifact	Eye-artifact		Artifact from eye blinking. In EEG, Fp1/Fp2 electrodes become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye.	Eye-artifact

HED_0012501	6	Horizontal-eye-movement-artifact	Eye-movement-artifact		Artifact from moving eyes left-to-right and right-to-left. In EEG, there is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.	Eye-movement-artifact
HED_0012502	6	Nystagmus-artifact	Eye-movement-artifact		Artifact from nystagmus (a vision condition in which the eyes make repetitive, uncontrolled movements).	Eye-movement-artifact

In EEG, this causes positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bi-frontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotates upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball is associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections is similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.	Eye-movement-artifact

HED_0012510	4	Sweat-artifact	Biological-artifact		Artifact from sweating. In EEG, this is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.	Biological-artifact
HED_0012511	4	Tongue-movement-artifact	Biological-artifact		Artifact from tongue movement (Glossokinetic). The tongue functions as a dipole, with the tip negative with respect to the base. In EEG, the artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.	Biological-artifact
