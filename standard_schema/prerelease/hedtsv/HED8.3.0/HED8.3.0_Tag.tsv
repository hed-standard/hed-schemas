HED_0012497	EMG-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact from muscle activity and myogenic potentials at the measurements site. In EEG, myogenic potentials are the most common artifacts. Frontalis and temporalis muscles (e.g. clenching of jaw muscles) are common causes. Generally, the potentials generated in the muscles are of shorter duration than those generated in the brain. The frequency components are usually beyond 30-50 Hz, and the bursts are arrhythmic.		Biological-artifact
HED_0012498	Eye-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Ocular movements and blinks can result in artifacts in different types of data. In electrophysiology data, these can result transients and offsets the signal.		Biological-artifact
HED_0012499	Eye-blink-artifact	5	Eye-artifact		Artifact from eye blinking. In EEG, Fp1/Fp2 electrodes become electropositive with eye closure because the cornea is positively charged causing a negative deflection in Fp1/Fp2. If the eye blink is unilateral, consider prosthetic eye.		Eye-artifact
HED_0012500	Eye-movement-artifact	5	Eye-artifact		Eye movements can cause artifacts on recordings. The charge of the eye can especially cause artifacts in electrophysiology data.		Eye-artifact
HED_0012501	Horizontal-eye-movement-artifact	6	Eye-movement-artifact		Artifact from moving eyes left-to-right and right-to-left. In EEG, there is an upward deflection in the Fp2-F8 derivation, when the eyes move to the right side. In this case F8 becomes more positive and therefore. When the eyes move to the left, F7 becomes more positive and there is an upward deflection in the Fp1-F7 derivation.		Eye-movement-artifact
HED_0012502	Nystagmus-artifact	6	Eye-movement-artifact		Artifact from nystagmus (a vision condition in which the eyes make repetitive, uncontrolled movements).		Eye-movement-artifact

HED_0012504	Vertical-eye-movement-artifact	6	Eye-movement-artifact		Artifact from moving eyes up and down. In EEG, this causes positive potentials (50-100 micro V) with bi-frontal distribution, maximum at Fp1 and Fp2, when the eyeball rotates upward. The downward rotation of the eyeball is associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections is similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.		Eye-movement-artifact
HED_0012505	Movement-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact in the measured data generated by motion of the subject.		Biological-artifact
HED_0012506	Pulse-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		A mechanical artifact from a pulsating blood vessel near a measurement site, cardioballistic artifact.		Biological-artifact

HED_0012509	Sucking-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact from sucking, typically seen in very young cases.		Biological-artifact
HED_0012510	Sweat-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact from sweating. In EEG, this is a low amplitude undulating waveform that is usually greater than 2 seconds and may appear to be an unstable baseline.		Biological-artifact
HED_0012511	Tongue-movement-artifact	4	Biological-artifact		Artifact from tongue movement (Glossokinetic). The tongue functions as a dipole, with the tip negative with respect to the base. In EEG, the artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.		Biological-artifact
HED_0012512	Nonbiological-artifact	3	Data-artifact		A data artifact arising from a non-biological source.		Data-artifact
HED_0012513	Artificial-ventilation-artifact	4	Nonbiological-artifact		Artifact stemming from mechanical ventilation. These can occur at the same rate as the ventilator, but also have other patterns.		Nonbiological-artifact
